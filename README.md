## Insights

- Certificate generation is awesome. (Alternatively: Creating certificates is a great way to track progress.)
- Ruby is a powerful and elegant language – definitely a keeper!
- Perl, like Ruby, is a very concise and beautiful language, but you absolutely have to delve deeper into regular expressions – cool language!
- Base64 refers to the 64 distinct characters used for encoding; there are many variations like Base62 (often used for URL shorteners) or even Base58 (used in Bitcoin).
